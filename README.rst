pybier
-------

To use simply:

    >>> from pybier import ucsc_utils
    >>> ucsc_utils.get_DNA_seq('chr11',61731757,61735132)

or maybe

    >>> from pybier import gdrive_utils
    >>> gdrive_utils.gdrive_upload(local_dir, gdrive_loc, SLURM = False)

Overall pybier is just a personal package for utils that I commonly use
It is also helping me learn how to structure python packages
